## Overview

- This project is a javaFX interface based food ordering system designed to order food items and managed by admin,
  implemented in Java. Also demonstrate various fundamental OOP conceptsâ€”such as
  classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, generic programming, exception handling and
  abstraction.

## Classes

1. ### Admin :
   Provide various methods and attributes related to Admin for managing menu and orders.

2. ### Customer :
   Provide various methods and attributes related to Customer for ordering food items and managing orders.

3. ### Item :
   Provide various methods and attributes related to Item for storing and accessing related details like
   ItemName,Price,Category,etc.

4. ### Order :
   Provide various methods and attributes related to Order for storing and accessing related details like
   OrderId,Items,Customer,etc.

5. ### Review :
   Provide various methods and attributes related to Review for storing and accessing related details like
   Items,Rating,Description,etc.

6. ### TextFormat (abstract)

   #### Methods
    - `textCenter()` : return a formatted string which has text at center and fills empty space with '-'
    - `cls()` : clear the console for more readable view
    - `pause()` : pause execution until pressed Enter

7. ### App

   #### Attributes
    - `appCustomers` : stores all signed customer
    - `appItems` : stores all added items
    - `appOrders` : stores all order from non-vip customers
    - `appVipOrders` : stores all order from VIP customers
    - `appReviews` : stores all item reviews

   #### Methods
    - Corresponding getters and setters for above all attributes

    - `Menu()` : provide main menu to select user type
    - `viewItems()` : show all details of the courses provided to its parameter
    - `viewCart()` : show all details of the student provided to its parameter
    - `viewOrders()` : show all details of the complaints provided to its parameter
    - `viewReviews()` : show all details of the complaints provided to its parameter

8. ### Pair
   Used to store a pair of objects

## Interfaces

Following interfaces provides blueprint of their corresponding classes -

1. `Admin_Interface`
2. `Customer_Interface`

## Tests

1. `AdminLoginTest` : Test cases to check admin login on wrong and correct case.
2. `CustomerLoginTest` : Test cases to check customer login on wrong and correct case.
3. `ItemOrderingTest` : Test cases to check adding of an out-of-stock order.

## Files

1. `Customers.ser` : stores an TreeMap of Customer email and object used for logging and signing.
2. `Orders.ser` : stores an TreeMap of OrderID and its corresponding Order object for a Non-Vip customer.
3. `VipOrders.ser` : stores an TreeMap of OrderID and its corresponding Order object for a Vip customer..

## Exceptions

- `InvalidLoginException` : Wrong email or password

## OOPs Concept

1. **Encapsulation** :<br>
   It is implemented by making data or attributes private within each class and
   provides public getter and setter methods to access or set it.<br>
   For example:
    - The `Customer` class encapsulates `name`, `email`, `password` and provides method like `getName()`, `setName()`,
      `setEmail()`, etc.


2. **Abstract Class** :<br>
   The `TextFormat` class is an abstract class which implements some of the common properties and behaviors which is
   used in almost all classes (`Customer`, `Admin`, and `Item`).
   It is inherited by `Customer`, `Admin` class.


3. **Inheritance** :<br>
   It is applied by creating a base class `App` which is inherited by `Admin`, `Customer`, `Order`. Each
   subclass extends the functionality of `App`.


4. **Interfaces** : <br>
   `Admin_Interface`, `Customer_Interface` interface defines the contract for following classes - `Admin`, `Customer`.
   This ensures that any class implementing this interface must provide concrete implementations for these
   methods.


5. **Polymorphism** : <br>
   It is demonstrated by method overriding. All subclasses of `App` (`Customer`, `Admin`, `Order`) override the `Menu()`
   method to display their specific menu.


6. **Generic Programming** : <br>
   It is demonstrated by the `Pair<T,U>` class which is a generic class designed to store a pair.


7. **Exception Handling** : <br>
   Custom exceptions are used to handle specific errors, such as :

    - **Invalid login credentials** : `InvalidLoginException`

## Assumptions

- **Fixed username for Administration** : Admin
- **Fixed password for Administration** : Admin@123
- **No sign up for Administration**
- The admin can update the status of first three prior orders only with VIP orders at first.
- For a non-VIP customer, there is a delivery fee of 20.
- For a VIP customer, there is no delivery fee.
- Admin can only refund the orders which are `Denied` or `Cancelled`.
- `Customer` is identified uniquely by their `email`.
- `Item` is identified uniquely by their `name`.
- `Order` is identified uniquely by their `orderID`.
- During login only three wrong password tries given.
- Customer can only add review for items that he/she has ordered and delivered.
- A customer's review is anonymous.
- A customer can submit any number of reviews for an item.
- An order has the following status - 
  - `Recieved` : When order is just placed by a customer
  - `Preparing` : When order is being prepared
  - `Out For Delivery` : When order is prepared and sent to be delivered 
  - `Delivered` : Order received by customer
  - `Cancelled` : Cancelled by customer
  - `Denied` : Order with a removed items which is not prepared or already delivered
