## Overview

**Byte Me** is a comprehensive food ordering system developed in Java using the JavaFX framework. This application features both graphical (GUI) and command-line (CLI) interfaces, enabling users to easily browse, order, and review food items. The system supports both user and admin roles with functionalities such as login/sign-up, menu management, order placement, cart operations, and item reviews. Data persistence is achieved using serialization, and JUnit is utilized for thorough testing. Managed by an administrator who oversees orders and ensures smooth operation, Byte Me demonstrates robust exception handling, abstraction, and other essential programming practices.
